# Yo.
These routines are designed and constructed from studying and listening to people who are of high regard in this field, namely: Andrew Huberman, Andy Galpin, Rhonda Patrick, Jeremy Ethier, Jeff Nippard, and their likes. In most cases, if not always, I will cite their videos/papers/references in the routines I included on this page.

Please note that if there's ever a contradiction in the routines I listed here with what these people preach, then such a contradiction may be due to the following reasons:

`Time constraints`

:   I do not have the time to replicate everything that they suggested. In this case, I will modify it in such a way that does not introduce negative implications to the routine(s) as best as I can.

`I do not know`

:   There are more than thousands of these resources out there that I have yet to find out.

With that said, please contact me (email at the bottom of this page) if there is any mistake(s) for I want to be corrected.
