# IN PROGRESS

!!! warning "Some reminders/warnings"

    - Progression is important for muscle growth. If overtime the current setup is too easy (i.e: you can do up to 20 reps or it takes 20 reps to reach the *until-failure* bar), apply progressions (ex: add resistance bands for push-ups or put on a weighted backpack. For weights exercises, just increase the weights) [^4]
